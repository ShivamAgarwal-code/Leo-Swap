To connect DeFi values of open finance and Cyberpunk ideology of human right to Privacy.

# LeoSwap (DEX) project description

### Enabling private cross chain atomic swaps for liquidity providing 
By implementing this solution, we unlock two key features of our DEX. The first is cross-chain atomic swaps, which enable secure bridging of assets across different blockchain networks. This functionality allows users to seamlessly transfer assets between chains while ensuring the integrity and security of the transactions.
The second feature is cross-chain liquidity providing, which connects the values of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) with the Cyberpunk ideology of privacy as a human right. By bridging liquidity across multiple chains ( here Aleo and XDC ),we empower users to access a wider range of liquidity and facilitate frictionless swaps. 
Together, these features enhance the capabilities of our DEX, providing users with a seamless, secure, and privacy-focused experience that combines the benefits of open finance and the principles of Cyberpunk ideology.

We where able to deploy our contracts into 3 EVM compatible network : 

XDC : 0xa46F57DABcB8406463EB1891e973baEa266b28AE

Scroll :  0x7eE12e666158788b174FE311D0b67524910910ca

Gnosis Chain : 0x7eE12e666158788b174FE311D0b67524910910ca


The idea is to be able to swap from Aleo to any EVM, and that is the aim by deploying our solidity swapping smart contract into those 3 EVM compatible blockchain.

### How to use LeoSwap

A frictionless, intuitive system, quick to use: 

1- Open dapp

2-  Connect your Aleo wallet 

3- Launch cross chain atomic swap

4- choose the timelock to make the matching for the atomicswap 

5- Choose for only get it on you wallet or create a liquidity pool and provide it ( or provide a liquidity pool directly)

6- Enjoy
